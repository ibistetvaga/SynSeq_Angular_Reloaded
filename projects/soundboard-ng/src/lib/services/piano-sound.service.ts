 *  - glass        : crystalline sine + light inharmonic shimmer
 *  - marimba      : warm triangle fundamental + quick-decay wood tone
 *  - musicBox     : bell-like partials with very fast decay
 *  - softPiano    : gentler version of `piano` with subdued upper harmonics
 *  - softPad      : slow-attack detuned sines, the calmest voice
 *
 * More characterful voices come after:
 *  - piano        : acoustic-ish piano with decaying partials
 *  - bell         : FM-ish bell with inharmonic ratios
 *  - organ        : full Hammond-like harmonic stack
 *  - pluck        : triangle fundamental with fast release
 *  - lead         : detuned saw pair (synth lead)
 *  - bass         : sine sub + slight triangle harmonic
 *  - pad          : detuned sines + subtle triangle harmonic
